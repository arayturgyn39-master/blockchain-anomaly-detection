AI-driven anomaly detection in blockchain transactions (Applied AI portfolio project)

# Blockchain Anomaly Detection using AI  

This project explores the use of AI and machine learning to detect unusual or fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks.  
It connects my academic background in blockchain research with applied AI methods, demonstrating practical skills in data science and anomaly detection.  

## Goals  
- Load blockchain transaction datasets (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Steemit).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.  
- Build AI models (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder).  
- Evaluate results with precision, recall, and ROC curves.  

## Status  
ðŸš€ Work in progress â€” repository created on Sept 18, 2025.  
Initial setup done today. Datasets and experiments will follow soon.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- PyTorch (for deep models)  

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Upload dataset link  
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- [ ] Train baseline anomaly detection model  
- [ ] Add visualization of anomalies  
- [ ] Build Streamlit demo
